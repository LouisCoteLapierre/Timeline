- Add a LastModified entry that is not modifiable from the UI but is modified everytime a TimelineEvent
is created or updated.
-Figure out a way to only show a specific amount of items in the DataGrid without everything being added
in the Items list, if we don't do that, the Items list will become WAY too big and will cause
major slowdowns of the program.
-support none timeline historic period so that by default it does into none.txt
-support changing category -> delete in the old category dictionary

-Links will be between [] so when the TimelineApp needs to write a text, it will check if there's
any [] in the text and if so will replace the text between the [] with a link to the specified
TimelineEvent's page. The text between the [] will be used to calculate the hash the same way
it is calculated when the TimelineEvent is created.
