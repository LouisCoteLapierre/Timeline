-Figure out a way to only show a specific amount of items in the DataGrid without everything being added
in the Items list, if we don't do that, the Items list will become WAY too big and will cause
major slowdowns of the program.	

-Links will be between [] so when the TimelineApp needs to write a text, it will check if there's
any [] in the text and if so will replace the text between the [] with a link to the specified
TimelineEvent's page. The text between the [] will be used to calculate the hash the same way
it is calculated when the TimelineEvent is created.

Try and remove HistoricPeriods in HistoricPeriodsModel to have the dictionary part of the ObservableCollection
Use this to, when adding entries, add them at the proper spot so it's already sorted, since it would already be sorted, no need to create a List copy whenever we get a key press

Add Image section
Keep order of list in spite of updates (Every update brings the entry to the bottom of the list) not a priority
Make scroller more visible (contrast)
Follow selected entry when the order is changed in list
Create a visual option for family trees (Mythology)
Make Vertical scroll bar always visible
When the current column is Title, keypress checks title, if its start/end/geography/type, it checks those attributes instead

SIMPLE ONES:
Show amount of entries
