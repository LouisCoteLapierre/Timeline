-Figure out a way to only show a specific amount of items in the DataGrid without everything being added
in the Items list, if we don't do that, the Items list will become WAY too big and will cause
major slowdowns of the program.	

-Links will be between [] so when the TimelineApp needs to write a text, it will check if there's
any [] in the text and if so will replace the text between the [] with a link to the specified
TimelineEvent's page. The text between the [] will be used to calculate the hash the same way
it is calculated when the TimelineEvent is created.
